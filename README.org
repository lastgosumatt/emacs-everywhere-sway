A re-implementation of the fantastic idea in [[https://github.com/zachcurry/emacs-anywhere][zachcurry/emacs-anywhere]].

* About

This is a test version for Sway/Wayland only. Mostly is taken from https://github.com/tecosaur/emacs-everywhere


** Dependencies

On Linux, ensure you have the following dependencies satisfied: =wtype=, =jq=, =wl-copy=.

* Usage

Invoke the Emacs Everywhere executable^{†}.
I recommend doing this by [[*Binding a Shortcut][binding a shortcut]] to:
#+begin_src shell
emacsclient --eval "(emacs-everywhere)"
#+end_src

A new Emacs frame will appear, within which you can type away to your heart's content.
It will remember which window you have focused.

By default, ~emacs-everywhere-insert-selection~ is a hook in
~emacs-everywhere-init-hooks~, and will insert the last text selection into your
new buffer. To clear this, type =DEL= or =C-SPC= /before anything else/.

Once you've finished and want to insert the text into the window you triggered
Emacs Everywhere from, just press =C-c C-c= or =C-x 5 0= to close the frame and
paste the content into the window (as long as ~emacs-everywhere-paste-p~ is
non-nil).

If you do /not/ wish to paste the buffer content into the original window, =C-c
C-k= still copies the content to the clipboard, but never pastes.

-----

^{*†*} This requires the Emacs daemon to be running, but that's super easy.
Just call =emacs --daemon= and you're sorted!

* Binding a Shortcut

Emacs-everywhere needs a way to launch when a not-emacs application has focus. The easiest way to do this is to have a global keybinding/keyboard shortcut dedicated to launching (same as above): ~emacsclient --eval "(emacs-everywhere)"~

Add do Sway config: bindsym Print exec emacsclient --eval "(emacs-everywhere)"
